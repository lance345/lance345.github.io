    What's Up I'm Lincoln!
<p> How y'all doin I'm Lincoln I was raised in a place that basically shaped me into who I am today, Lynn, Ma. "Lynn, Lynn the city of sin the way you come out is not the way you came in." Lynn is a place not a lot of people can grow up in. It taught me and my siblings values that we still use to this day. </p>
